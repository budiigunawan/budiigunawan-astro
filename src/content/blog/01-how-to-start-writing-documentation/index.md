To understand the quote above, you have to picture this scenario: It’s your first day at the office, you are working with legacy projects and there are no docs around to learn. As a new joiner, you will spend much of your time reverse-engineering the project. Now picture another scenario: The documentation of legacy projects is accurate and up to date. You can read the genuinely helpful documentation.

If documentation is so important, why are we not invested in documentation? Honestly, the answer is not because we (developers) are not invested in it, it’s because many of us don’t know how to do it. So, here are some tips for starting writing documentation, based on the book “Docs for Developers: An Engineer’s Field Guide to Technical Writing.”

## [1] Understanding Your Audience

> “Humans assume others have the same knowledge they do.”, this cognitive bias is called “the curse of knowledge” and was determined by a group of economists at Harvard in the late 1980s.

To break this curse, you have to start writing effective documentation that requires empathy for your users. You can build the empathy with user research and its tools:

1. Support Ticket — Support tickets are a gold mine for understanding your users. To analyze your support tickets, pull a list of recently filled issues that relate to what you’re documenting, and then group them by theme.
2. Interview — it’s important to prepare your topics in advance to keep the conversations focused and useful. Some high-level topics could be previous experience using a similar product and expectations while using the product.
3. Surveys — If you don’t have much time for in-depth interviews, surveys can give you more actionable and immediate insights. Good survey questions are asking one thing per question, limited answers, and are neutral.
