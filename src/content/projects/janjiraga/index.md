During the development of this project, we implemented a feature to display venue maps. This was my first experience using Mapbox, and it proved to be an enlightening journey.

One key takeaway was the ease of use Mapbox offers compared to other mapping solutions, such as the Google Maps API. Its intuitive interface and comprehensive documentation streamlined the integration process, facilitating a smoother development experience.
